Things to implement:
1. Better comments
2. Add push of outbound messages to BOS from remote agie svr via their designated interface transport queue.
3. Create the BOS (Back Office Server) AGIE implentation.  It will include the following:
    A. Master queue per associated remote aircraft.
    B. Child transport queues for each active network transport to the remote aircraft.
    C.
4. Add function to send message to BOS when networks come up or down.   This
will then allow the BOS to create tmp queues for outbound messages by net.
The remote agie svr can then reach back to the bos broker and pull messages
over a given net.  When a net drops the outbound transport queue is deleted.
All transient queues should have alt exchange that delivers them back to the
inbound data message queue for rerouting.   We could also split the master
data queues in theory. 
5. Add option to re-evaluate queued messages in live outbound queue for better
paths.  This will be needed in both remote and BOS.   
6. Switch from direct to topics
